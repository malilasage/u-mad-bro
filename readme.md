# U Mad Bro?

U Mad Bro is a smartwatch app designed for the Pebble watch. The app is intended to be an assistive technology to help people who might otherwise have a difficult time distinguishing different emotional sentiments in conversation, such as those with autism. The watch picks up on conversation and, using the IBM Watson [Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/), subtly shows a color corresponding to the dominant emotion in the speech.

This application was created in 24 hours during the [Hack CU](https://2017.hackcu.org/) hackathon in Boulder, Colorado. Our project won 3rd place.

Since our code is spread across Github and the CloudPebble IDE and had so many contributors, we created a video to demonstrate our final product. Click on the image above to view the video in Vimeo.

### Note
The api was created and deployed seperately and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/THEAverageSpeedBurrito/speech_to_color_api).
